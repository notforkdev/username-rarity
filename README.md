# Username Rarity
This is just a random project I felt like making because I couldnt find any tool to see the rarity of my username, there are three factors to checking your rarity (factor 3 is to check if ur edgy)
# Factors
Factor 1: Shortness | Basically just if your username is short you get score
Factor 2: Basic Words | If your username is literally a basic word, as in for example duck or smth it increases the rarity.
Factor 3: Common suffixes/prefixes | you lose score for containing common suffixes/prefixes. They are also edgy because idk.
# Packages
This repository used ntlk for one of the factors, it is required to be used if you want the script to work.
Run the following in the console to install ntlk `pip install nltk`
